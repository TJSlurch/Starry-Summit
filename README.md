When given the open-ended assignment of a coding a project, I decided to create a game due to my interest in videogames and passion for game-development.

The concept for my game is a 2D platformer centred around semi-precise platforming where the player traverses through sections filled with spikes, moving platforms and other obstacles. The game is relatively simple and intuitive for players of any skill level to understand and play, but I also incorporated optional challenge sections for skilled players.


There is support for both keyboard and xbox one controller input.
